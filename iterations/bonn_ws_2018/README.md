**Semester Start** October 8th, 2018

We meet Thursdays between 14:15-15:45 in SR 0.017.

**Lecturer** [Philipp Eisenhauer](https://peisenha.github.io/build/html/index.html)

**Assistant** [Valerie Stottuth](https://github.com/vstottuth)

## Grading

Each participant summarizes and evaluates an applied research article in light of the conceptual framework we develop during the course. The goal is to clearly delineate the definition of the parameter of interest, its identification, and the estimation approach. The results are shared within the group by means of a presentation and short manuscript.

## Lectures

The core lectures are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/econometrics/blob/master/README.md).

## Presentation Schedule

Each student presents a research article of his/her choice (20 minutes). Directly following the presentation a discussion between the course participants is being considered (round about 5 to 10 minutes). We will peer-review the presentations using the grading rubric available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/econometrics/blob/master/material/presentation-grading.pdf).
